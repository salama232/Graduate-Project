sudo apt-get remove libavcodec-extra-56 libavformat56 libavresample2 libavutil54
wget https://github.com/ccrisan/motioneye/wiki/precompiled/ffmpeg_3.1.1-1_armhf.deb
sudo dpkg -i ffmpeg_3.1.1-1_armhf.deb
sudo apt-get install curl libssl-dev libcurl4-openssl-dev libjpeg-dev libx264-142 libavcodec56 libavformat56 libmysqlclient18 libswscale3 libpq5
wget https://github.com/Motion-Project/motion/releases/download/release-4.0.1/pi_jessie_motion_4.0.1-1_armhf.deb
sudo dpkg -i pi_jessie_motion_4.0.1-1_armhf.deb
Find the following lines and change them to the following.
daemon on
stream_localhost off
Note: Change the following two lines from on to off if you’re having issues with the stream freezing whenever motion occurs.
output_pictures off
ffmpeg_output_movies off
Optional (Don’t include the text in brackets)
stream_maxrate 100 (This will allow for real-time streaming but requires more bandwidth & resources)
framerate 100 (This will allow for 100 frames to be captured per second allowing for smoother video)
width 640 (This changes the width of the image displayed)
height 480 (This changes the height of the image displayed)
Now we need to setup up the daemon, first we need to edit the motion file.
sudo nano /etc/default/motion
Find the following line and change it to the following:
start_motion_daemon=yes
Once you’re done simply save and exit by pressing ctrl+x then y.
Now make sure the camera is connected and run the following line:
sudo service motion start
If you need to stop the service, simply run the following command:
sudo service motion stop
Now you should be able to check out the Webcam Stream at the IP address of our Pi so in your browser go to the following address:
192.168.1.103:8081
If the webpage isn’t loading try restarting the service.
sudo service motion restart
